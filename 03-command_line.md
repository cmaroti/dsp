### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

* pwd = show current working directory path
* mkdir [new directory] = creating a directory
* rmdir [directory] = deleting a directory
* touch [filename] = creating a file using `touch` command
* rm [filename] = deleting a file
* mv [oldfile] [newfile] = renaming a file
* ls -a = listing hidden files
* cp [file] [directory] = copying a file from one directory to another
* cat [filename] = stream contents of a file (also can use more)
* pushd [directory] = saves your current place, then goes to the directory specified
* popd = goes back to the last directory

* ls -lh = long form but with file size in bytes, KB, MB, etc.
* ls -lah = long form, includes hidden files, includes file size suffixes  
* ls -t = lists files sorted by most recently modified
* ls -Glp = long form, the 'p' inserts a slash after directory names, and the 'G' tells it not to print group names
